# Datasets used
Dataset sampling is still WIP. Training dataset is different for the Hardware (FPGA) and Software (RasPi) but only in size (Hardware is larger). This is due to the hardware approximation techniques giving different histograms than the software implementation. However, the resulting accuracy is still very similar so far in testing.
