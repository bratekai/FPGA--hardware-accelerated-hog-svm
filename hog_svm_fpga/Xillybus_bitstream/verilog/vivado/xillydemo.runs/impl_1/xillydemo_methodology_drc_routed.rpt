2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock ap_clk is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks ap_clk and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks ap_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_1 and ap_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_1] -to [get_clocks ap_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks ap_clk and clk_fpga_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks ap_clk] -to [get_clocks clk_fpga_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_1 and ap_clk are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_1] -to [get_clocks ap_clk]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-10#1 Warning
Missing property on synchronizer  
One or more logic synchronizer has been detected between 2 clock domains but the synchronizer does not have the property ASYNC_REG defined on one or both registers. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on GPIO_LED[0] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on GPIO_LED[1] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on GPIO_LED[2] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on GPIO_LED[3] relative to clock(s) clk_fpga_1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-24#1 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 5 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks clk_fpga_1 and vga_clk_ins/clkout2 overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 13). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-24#2 Warning
Overridden Max delay datapath only  
A set_clock_groups or a set_false path (see constraint position 6 in the Timing Constraints window in Vivado IDE) between clocks vga_clk_ins/clkout2 and clk_fpga_1 overrides a set_max_delay -datapath_only (position 11). It is not recommended to override a set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint. Replace the set_clock_groups or set_false_path between clocks with point-to-point set_false_path constraints
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock ap_clk is created on an inappropriate internal pin HLS_wrapper_2/ap_clk. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#1 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock vga_clk_ins/clk_fb is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 5 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). It is recommended to reference an auto-derived clock by the pin name attached to the clock: get_clocks -of_objects [get_pins xillybus_ins/system_i/vivado_system_i/xillyvga_0/inst/xillyvga_core_ins/vga_clk_ins/vga_mmcm/CLKFBOUT]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-28#2 Warning

TIMING-28#3 Warning
Auto-derived clock referenced by a timing constraint  
The auto-derived clock vga_clk_ins/clkout2 is referenced by name inside timing constraint (see constraint position 5 in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE).

XDCC-4#1 Warning
User Clock constraint overwritten with the same name  
A new clock constraint create_clock overrides a previous user clock constraint with the same name.
